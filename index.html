				Hi,
				<a href="https://www.stellaseki.com/" target="_blank">I'm Stella</a> and
			</p>
			<h1>You're on my first self-coded webpage!</h1>
			<p>
				In early 2024, I made it a goal for myself to 1) finally learn how to
				write an html and css file from start to finish, and 2) get better at
				making artifacts that facilitate product decision making.
			</p>
			<p>
				To put these skills to the test, I’ve decided to combine these goals
				into one and create a showcase of some of the artifacts that I’m
				proudest of, in no particular order.
			</p>

				<h2>User Research Findings</h2>

					For Learning Platform Rebuild – A slide deck that breaks down the

					<p>
						<i>“We’ve never tested this before, and I’m worried about ...”</i>
					</p>
					<p>
						Our previous research session had never gotten the visibility it
						deserved, and didn’t help our stakeholders feel reassured about the
						efficacy of my design proposals.

						<h3>What made it click</h3>
					</div>
					<p>
						My audience didn’t participate in or get any context on the user
						research effort.
					</p>
					<p>
						I realized that it’d help them trust the data I’m communicating more
						if I explained the methodology and demographic background of our
						participants.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="column">
					<div class="detail-name">
						<img src="./assets/rocket-launch.svg" alt="rocket launch" />
						<h3>Impact</h3>
					</div>
					<p>
						This deck was able to generate asynchronous discussion about user
						story we hadn’t heavily considered! While we aren’t taking action
						now, this gives context to metrics we should keep an eye on when we
						launch.

				<h2>UI Kit (for a future design system)</h2>
				<p>
					For Learning Platform Rebuild – A robust Figma file that defines a new
					token system and hosts a library of components that transform with
					theme
				</p>
			</div>

				<div class="column">
					<div class="detail-name">
						<img src="./assets/thought-bubble.svg" alt="thought-bubble" />
						<h3>Why I made it</h3>
					</div>
					<p>
						In our legacy system rebuild, our developers were inundated with so
						many complex problems that long term, front end flexibility was a
						tough burden to shoulder.
					</p>
					<p>
						As somewhat of a design system fanatic, I took it upon myself to
						create the starting draft of a theme-shifting token system and
						consolidated a year’s worth of my own decision making.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column">
					<div class="detail-name">
						<img src="./assets/lightbulb-on.svg" alt="lightbulb-on" />
						<h3>What made it click</h3>
					</div>
					<p>
						Developer and design experience first – every time I observed a
						designer or a developer use Figma, I took lots of notes on their
						habits and pain points as if it was a user research session.
					</p>
					<p>
						Additionally, I spent a lot of time consulting a developer on
						responsible token practices and researched other design systems.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column">
					<div class="detail-name">
						<img src="./assets/rocket-launch.svg" alt="rocket-launch" />
						<h3>Impact</h3>
					</div>
					<p>
						This UI kit served as the blueprint for CSS variables that our team
						uses and expedited the development process.
					</p>
					<p>
						Developers no longer had to find common threads across multiple
						designs or plan out tokens, and could trust that what they built
						would work as it was defined.

					<p>
						As I was doing my own discovery work on a broadly scoped project,
						other designers were getting onboarded onto adjacent projects..
						quickly. I thought this would be a nice way for them to onboard onto
						their own faster-paced projects, while it also helped my own project
						out.

						Placing screenshots on each step of the flow helped product
						stakeholders build familiarity with the parent journey and its
						existing pain points.

				<div class="column">
					<div class="detail-name">

						<h3>Why I made it</h3>
					</div>
					<p>
						I had an ever-growing hoard of screenshots that I was losing track
						of. Many buttons led to slightly different resulting screens, and it
						became impossible for me to remember what I’d discovered while
						exploring our current product.

					<p>Arrows!!</p>
					<p>
						On screens with lots of hidden, deceptive buttons, it was worth
						mapping out every single action and resulting reaction.

				<div class="column">

					<p>
						This artifact helped me realize how many modals we have, especially
						on a single screen!!! At some point, this became a map that I could
						use to scare us into doing something about that..

			<h2>Wrapping up...</h2>
			<p>
				As the year wraps up, I’m still finding loose ends and lots of
				conversations that are probably getting lost in the noise. But as a
				product designer, I feel proud of contributing what I can to each of the
				initiatives I work on!
			</p>
			<p>
				At the end of the day, generating artifacts feels like working through
				the design process. I’m still thinking about the end user (our project
				teams) and what problems we are facing that could be addressed with a
				solution I create.
